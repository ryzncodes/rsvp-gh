## RSVP Modal Scaling Issue

### Problem
The RSVP form modal appeared too zoomed in, with elements appearing disproportionately large relative to the container.

### Solution
1. Increased the modal size:
   - Increased `max-width` from 550px to 650px
   - Increased `max-height` from 85vh to 90vh
   - Increased padding from 25px to 30px

2. Scaled down content inside the modal:
   - Added specific styles for form elements within the modal
   - Created more compact form groups with 90% max-width and centered alignment
   - Reduced form spacing with smaller margins between elements
   - Specified smaller padding for inputs and radio options
   - Added a specific font size for the header (28px)
   - Added clearer styling for the instructions text
   - Made the submit button more appropriately sized

3. Improved close button appearance:
   - Repositioned for better visibility
   - Added background and border-radius for better usability
   - Reduced font size from 28px to 24px
   - Added flex centering for better alignment

### Key CSS Properties Used
- `max-width` and `max-height` for controlling container dimensions
- `margin` and `padding` for adjusting spacing
- `font-size` for text scaling
- Descendant selectors (`.modal .form-group`) for targeting specific elements within the modal 

## Hidden Scrollbar Implementation

### Problem
The RSVP modal had visible scrollbars that were distracting and affected the clean aesthetic of the design.

### Solution
Applied CSS to hide scrollbars while maintaining scroll functionality:

1. Modal container scrollbar:
   - Used `scrollbar-width: none` for Firefox
   - Used `-ms-overflow-style: none` for Internet Explorer and Edge
   - Used `::-webkit-scrollbar { display: none }` for Chrome, Safari, and Opera

2. Textarea scrollbar:
   - Added specific styling to hide scrollbars in the textarea element
   - Applied the same cross-browser approach (Firefox, IE/Edge, and WebKit browsers)
   - Maintained `overflow-y: auto` to keep the scrolling functionality

3. Benefits:
   - Maintains scroll functionality for forms that might exceed the viewport
   - Creates a cleaner, more modern aesthetic
   - Consistent with mobile-like interfaces
   - Removes all visual scrollbar distractions

### Key CSS Properties Used
- `scrollbar-width` (Firefox)
- `-ms-overflow-style` (IE/Edge)
- `::-webkit-scrollbar` pseudo-element (WebKit browsers)
- `display: none`
- Element-specific selectors for targeting both the modal and textarea elements
