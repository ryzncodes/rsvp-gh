## RSVP Modal Scaling Issue

### Problem
The RSVP form modal appeared too zoomed in, with elements appearing disproportionately large relative to the container.

### Solution
1. Increased the modal size:
   - Increased `max-width` from 550px to 650px
   - Increased `max-height` from 85vh to 90vh
   - Increased padding from 25px to 30px

2. Scaled down content inside the modal:
   - Added specific styles for form elements within the modal
   - Created more compact form groups with 90% max-width and centered alignment
   - Reduced form spacing with smaller margins between elements
   - Specified smaller padding for inputs and radio options
   - Added a specific font size for the header (28px)
   - Added clearer styling for the instructions text
   - Made the submit button more appropriately sized

3. Improved close button appearance:
   - Repositioned for better visibility
   - Added background and border-radius for better usability
   - Reduced font size from 28px to 24px
   - Added flex centering for better alignment

### Key CSS Properties Used
- `max-width` and `max-height` for controlling container dimensions
- `margin` and `padding` for adjusting spacing
- `font-size` for text scaling
- Descendant selectors (`.modal .form-group`) for targeting specific elements within the modal
